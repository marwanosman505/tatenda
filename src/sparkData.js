          As a Spark Music Champion, I have developed and delivered a series of creative music
          sessions for children aged 0–4 and their families. These sessions blended hands-on,
          sensory-based play with digital music tools — including loop stations, microphones, and
          immersive soundscapes using digital audio workstations — to create engaging, inclusive
          experiences for early years audiences.

          A key focus of my approach was working in smaller groups, which allowed me to build
          meaningful musical relationships with children and parents. These close interactions
          created a sense of trust and playfulness, gradually building towards collaborative, fully
          immersive soundscapes. Families were encouraged to co-create live music using rhythm,
          voice, movement, and natural sounds—exploring sound not just as performance, but as a
          shared language.

          Sessions often began with an open invitation to play — using tactile resources like
          parachutes and sponges to support sensory exploration and developmental schemas —
          before transitioning into music-making with acoustic instruments and digital effects.
          Each workshop ended with a custom-designed sound bed, combining nature sounds,
          nursery rhymes, and carefully placed silence to prompt imagination and reflection.

          Through this work, I’ve deepened my understanding of how music supports early
          development, not only as a creative outlet, but also as a powerful tool for connection,
          communication, and confidence-building. My practice is rooted in curiosity,
          improvisation, and the belief that music belongs to everyone — no matter their age or
          experience.

          I’m passionate about bringing this work into new early years settings, nurseries, festivals,
          and creative family spaces, continuing to support young children and their caregivers
          through joyful, accessible music experiences.

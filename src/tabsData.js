            The project launched in November 2023 in partnership with
            Queensmead Primary Academy and Folville Junior School in
            Leicester. We alternated sessions weekly between the two
            schools, beginning with introductory activities aimed at
            building rapport and establishing trust with the young
            participants.

            The “Sing What You Mean, Mean What You Play” project focused
            on providing neurodivergent children aged 8–10 with
            opportunities to explore music and express themselves in ways
            that felt authentic to them.

            We started each session with fun games like "Pass the Clap,"
            "Don’t Clap This One Back," and voice-projection exercises to
            help the kids feel comfortable and break the ice. Journaling
            became a big part of the sessions—it gave the children a way
            to jot down ideas and explore their creativity.

            We also introduced loop pedals, which quickly became a hit,

            The children were split into small groups to keep things
            personal. At Folville, the kids enjoyed one-on-one time, where
            they could focus without feeling overwhelmed. Meanwhile,
            Queensmead’s group loved working together, feeding off each
            other’s energy. We always had a quiet room available for
            anyone who needed to take a breather—it was all about making
            sure everyone felt at ease.

            <b>Behavior and Focus at School 1</b> <br />
            Some children struggled with focus and behavior in sessions.
            To address this, we encouraged them to create their own rules
            and expectations for the workshops. This approach fostered a
            sense of ownership and responsibility, improving overall
            engagement.

            <b>Reserved Nature at School 2</b> <br />
            Participants at Folville were more reserved and hesitant to
            share ideas. Journaling and one-on-one activities provided a
            safe space for these children to express themselves at their
            own pace.

            <b>Balancing Individual and Group Dynamics</b> <br />
            At school 2, one-on-one activities were most effective, while
            at school 1, the children thrived in group settings. Adapting
            activities to suit each school’s dynamics was a key part of
            the project’s success.
